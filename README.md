<h1>Quantum Circuit Optimization for Complex Datasets</h1>

<p>This project explores the optimization of quantum circuits to minimize the infidelity of quantum states generated in relation to complex datasets. Various circuit configurations are examined, focusing on their depth, number of parameters, and non-local gates.</p>

<h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Parameter Definition:</b> A 'theta' parameter is defined to rotate qubits.</li>
  <li><b>Circuit Configuration:</b> Quantum circuits are constructed with varying numbers of qubits to analyze their performance on datasets of different sizes.</li>
  <li><b>Objective Function:</b> Infidelity is minimized between the ansatz state and a complex dataset to find the optimal parameter settings.</li>
  <li><b>Optimization Method:</b> The 'SLSQP' algorithm is used for parameter optimization within quantum circuits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results Analysis</h2>
<p>The experiment evaluates how the circuit's depth, number of parameters, number of non-local gates, infidelity, and optimization time vary with data length. Different encoding schemes (k values) are compared to understand their impact on circuit performance.</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increased data length leads to higher circuit depth and a greater number of parameters.</li>
  <li>Infidelity decreases with more precise optimization, but at the cost of increased computation time.</li>
  <li>The choice of encoding scheme significantly affects the circuit's ability to accurately represent complex datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The findings suggest that careful consideration must be given to circuit design and parameter optimization to effectively utilize quantum circuits for complex data representation. The balance between circuit complexity and computational efficiency is crucial for the practical application of quantum computing in data processing and analysis.</p>
